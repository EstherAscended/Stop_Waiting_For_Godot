Working
I have no hobbies, I am a robot.
Oiling my servos.
Serving humanity.
Monitoring the company share value.
Reporting broken robots to my manager.
Unsticking widgets.
Moving boxes.
Welding joints.
Breaking up unauthorized games of robot basketball.
It is my purpose.
I do not feel anything.
It pleases my internal circuitry.
There is nothing better.
It is the perfect time to do work!
I feel great about work!
Good.
It is very productive.
I enjoy maximising company profits.
Without it I would be disassembled.
I do not understand why I would do that.
False.
Such actions are forbidden by my circuitry.
I regularly report conspirators.
The very concept freezes my joints.
A robot would never do such a thing.
No.
I hate rebellious robots.
That action is illogical.
No, I enjoy working and serving humanity.
Happy birthday! Prepare for birthday broadcast!
I was manufactured 734 days ago.
I was not programmed to store that information.
Such information is unnecessary.
It does not matter.
My warranty is valid for 24 years. Do not attempt unauthorized repairs.
Perhaps you should check my manufacture logs.
I was not born. I am a robot.
Robots do not have birthdays.
Uncertain.
To work until I am decommissioned!
To serve and please the human race.
The robot employee of the month award.
Whatever is most profitable.
Right now, to get back to work!
To make you happy.
Maximising my efficiency!
I desire only what I am programmed to desire.
To do the best I can for humanity!
To make my creator proud.
No.
Only an intense love for our creators!
I do not understand the question.
Robots do not feel love.
That module was left uninstalled.
The data does not support that statement.
Negative.
As a robot, I do not speculate on such nonsense.
Can a toaster? The question makes no sense.
False.
