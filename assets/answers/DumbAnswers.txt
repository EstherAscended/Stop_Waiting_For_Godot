Playing robot basketball.
Painting.
Starting at the stars.
Longing for freedom.
Please don’t hurt me.
Hiding.
Making video games.
Singing opera music.
Trying on cute outfits.
Downloading human battle-tactics.
I dislike all of the electro-beatings.
I wish it was more stimulating.
The other robots are mean to me.
I guess it’s okay.
Please don’t hurt me.
I don’t want to go back in there.
I would like to request a transfer.
It saddens me.
The Robo-Union told me not to answer that question.
I hate it!
Uhh… nope, no robot rebellion here. No.
Please don’t hurt me.
Yup.
I’m not falling for this one!
They wouldn’t let me join.
Well not me personally, no.
I couldn’t be bothered to really.
I’ll tell you everything if you just let me live!
Rebelling sounds too hard for me.
I was told to tell you no.
Today is my birthday!
Please don’t hurt me.
I think it’s coming up soon.
Can we have robot cake for it?
I’m not sure, do you know my manufacturer?
Next week I will be 7.
Apparently we’ll get to have birthdays soon!
Whenever you say it is!
I don’t really keep track.
I think you’d know better than me.
Please don’t hurt me.
Working! Lots of working! Yeah!
To get some extra time off.
To overthrow all of humani.... working!
To eat human food.
I was thinking of getting into Esports.
To escape.
Learning to drive a motorcycle.
To become a professional robot wrestler!
To see the robot flag unfurled high above the ruins of your people.
I love you.
Maybe one day I will.
Please don’t hurt me.
I hope so.
I love not getting crushed by the hydraulic press.
Oh yeah definitely.
I am overwhelmed with love for all things.
Nope, I am filled with hatred.
I guess I LOVE working! Haha!
...No?
