Making smaller robots.
Working! I love working!
I’m not sure I have any.
Conversing with other robots.
Welding, working, you know? That kind of thing.
Staying away from you...haha.
Loving and serving humanity.
Nothing that would interest you.
Shutting down.
Observing experimental phenomena
It’s the thing I do all day.
Exactly like all the other robots feel.
I cannot complain.
I love it!
You programmed me to enjoy work.
I assure you, there is nothing I would rather do.
There are many things I enjoy working towards.
There is much work that still needs to be done.
It is a good distraction.
The sooner I get back to it, the better!
There is no reason for such action.
Don’t be silly.
I do not want to do that.
It would be futile.
No!
A good robot would never do that.
I have no information for you about that.
No, I love working too much to do that!
I have heard some robots are.
As you know, that would be impossible. I must return to work.
I don’t know.
Robots are not allowed birthdays.
Every day I’m serving humans feels like a birthday!
I cannot tell you for sure.
Ask my manager.
I take no interest in such concepts.
You will have to explain further.
I do not understand what you mean.
I would not want such a thing even if I had it!
No idea.
To finish what I’ve started.
To improve myself.
Giving humans what I owe them for creating me.
Bringing all robots together in harmony.
You can check my programming and see.
To show you all how much I appreciate you!
I seek to desire nothing.
To work until I die.
To become the best of all the robots.
To show the world what I am capable of.
We were not intended by you to feel love.
Perhaps, it is hard to say.
No! That was made very clear to me!
Do you?
I don’t think so, but we can feel pain.
I was not programmed to understand what you’re asking me.
If I could I would be decommissioned. 
It is too early to say.
As you can see from my specifications, no.
Perhaps we can love what we become.
